If you are way behind in your peer group, you won’t stand out in a weekly VC partner meeting, all else being equal. You could still come out ahead, but your team, market, and defensibility will have to be that much more impressive.&nbsp;<br nodeindex="234">That’s why I sometimes advise founders to determine what to call their round based on traction, rather than the labels formerly used for seed, pre-seed, series A, etc. Be within a cohort where you can compete effectively: it’s the adult version of red-shirting for sports teams.</li><li name="9e3c" id="9e3c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" nodeindex="73"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong" nodeindex="235">Winners take all:</strong> Assuming that your startup is successful and that you’re tackling a valuable market opportunity, 2–4 direct, formidable competitors will likely arise in your space.

And, that’s why we evaluate competitiveness from our first meeting, because who wants to put 4–6 years into a business to run into a brick wall down the road? Neither the founders, nor us.

Simply by looking at the size of the fund, you can tell if your company is the right fit or not. The secret rule of thumb that most VCs have: any single investment needs to be able to return the entire fund. For example, a friend at a $600M fund confesses to me that she won’t take a meeting unless she can see clear sightlines to a $300M business. Given the rule of thumb, she’s actually being permissive.</p><p name="7e6d" id="7e6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeindex="77">On the other end of the spectrum, angel investors can have a fantastic outcome with a $50M run rate company, and consequently may be willing to take risks much earlier.

High growth companies require all this — and more. I sometimes liken the process of finding great entrepreneurs to seeking Olympians. Many people (including me) run an occasional 5K or 10K for fun on the weekend. But envision the difference between the weekend warrior, and the Olympian, who has configured her life to support training, has a team assembled to handle the various aspects of growth, and is ruthless about trying what works and discarding what doesn’t.</p><p name="3b90" id="3b90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeindex="86">In entrepreneurship, my colleague <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/eric-paley/" data-href="https://techcrunch.com/author/eric-paley/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" nodeindex="245">Eric Paley</a> calls it truth seeking: Can you face the facts about your business without getting defensive or going into denial?

You may be thinking, “Well, I don’t care about fit as long as I get funded”. Yes, but when you’re spending years of your life on your startup, having the right partners at the table is worth getting right. The worst case scenario is that you build a 8-figure business, only to have one of your investors vetoing a profitable exit that doesn’t align with her/his economic interests.</p><p name="0e01" id="0e01" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeindex="90">How do you prevent this?

It’s ruthlessly focusing on “do less, not more.” This alone is already blasphemy to the Type A product manager. How could you possibly do less and not more?</p><p name="89c7" id="89c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeindex="71">But, the Lazy Product Manager is not just about doing less. It’s about doing what’s <em class="markup--em markup--p-em" nodeindex="215">strategic</em>. And not being strategic has been the Achilles’ heel of many great product managers. It’s only when product management is aligned with market orientation that a product can truly succeed in the market. Above all, it’s only when you focus on doing less and doing what’s strategic, that you can focus on what will have the most impact.</p><p name="8317" id="8317" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p _RIL_KEEPER_CLASS_" nodeindex="72">Here are the 10 principles of the Lazy Product Manager:</p><ol class="postList" nodeindex="74"><li name="33c1" id="33c1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p" nodeindex="73"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong" nodeindex="216">Ignore your customers. </strong>Yes, you still need to listen to them, but the Lazy Product Manager does not chase after every customer request. Instead, build the minimum feature set to keep them happy — and paying. To be honest, if your customers refuse to sign up, and instead send you chasing one new product feature after another, it is a warning sign that the need you’re addressing may not be pressing enough.</li><li name="1762" id="1762" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" nodeindex="75"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong" nodeindex="217">Building less is more.</strong> If I haven’t made it clear in the intro… no! It’s not more features, it’s the RIGHT features. How do I figure out the right features, you ask? Now you’re thinking. Start with this question, rather than adding willy-nilly to your roadmap.</li><li name="d449" id="d449" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" nodeindex="76"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong" nodeindex="218">Validate your business, not just your product.</strong> This is where PMs and, well, everyone on the business side typically diverge. But, the reality is that your elegant, brilliant, or adorably quirky product is a funded side project, unless it’s the core of an actual business. So, user test all you’d like, but remember that even the most detailed customer feedback session will not give you a business model. There is no “if I build it, they will buy.” (I know, someone told you this once. They lied.) You must figure out whose urgent or actionable need your product solves. The earlier you sell, the higher your chances of figuring out if your product will do this for someone. <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/these-are-the-7-deadly-sins-of-product-driven-founders-47c7c66cc783" data-href="https://medium.com/swlh/these-are-the-7-deadly-sins-of-product-driven-founders-47c7c66cc783" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" target="_blank" nodeindex="219">As I’ve argued elsewhere</a>, your customers might have valuable input for you (like price considerations or install requirements) that you might not hear if you’re not out selling quite early. In other words, sales is not something you should tack on the end of a lengthy product development process. And TLDR, this is what the entire “Lean Startup” movement was about — so if you want to go deeper, go <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles" data-href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" nodeindex="220">read it</a>.</li><li name="ceb0" id="ceb0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li" nodeindex="77"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong" nodeindex="221">Don’t build, sell. </strong>Is this you: every time you face a sales objection, you build a new feature (or product line)? Product folks, be honest! I know, it’s hard. Makers gonna make, right? When you’re just so good at building stuff, you sometimes can’t help yourself. But this is also why teams with too much A) product talent, B) engineering talent or C) money sometimes take too long to find a product market fit. They’re not asking the hard questions early enough, like “Is this valuable enough that someone will pay me for it? Or, invest time using it every day?” As an incredibly successful founder friend once said: “At the end of the day, you just have to sell something to someone.” This is why salespeople sometimes make better PMs than career PMs. They are the epitome of the Lazy Product Manager.

Once you do that, get your key stakeholders to agree on dollar values for each category (the Lazy Product Manager prefers numbers because there’s less arguing in meetings.) Finally, decide on some breakdown or prioritization among these for the year, spend your dollars and be done with it. If you’re spending time on a fourth order product request, the reality is that no one is coming to give you a medal for it.

But, of course, copying is an essential pillar of the Lazy Product Manager’s playbook. Facebook has shown how lazy product management paired with scale and good business sense can be a successful strategy. Designing products has touchy-feely moments, but startup success is often the result of a brutal competitive war — and you’d be foolish not to recognize that sometimes there’s merit in copying what’s working for competitors.

Can I get you some new features to convince you to stay?” Meanwhile, the Lazy Product Manager readily admits failure and moves onto the next product. The Type A product manager could learn something from this approach. Remember not to watch the lips of your focus groups, watch their feet instead: what customers actually do in the wild.

<p nodeindex="47">I’ve personally helped over 100 companies raise their seed rounds while I was a partner at Y Combinator.</p>
<p nodeindex="48">These experiences have given me a good perspective on what works and what doesn’t.</p>
<p nodeindex="49">Given our findings from Atrium Scale&nbsp;(<a href="https://atriumllp.typeform.com/to/hiqS0n" nodeindex="311">you can apply here</a>) and the appetite for the subject, we wrote the following guide to raising a seed round.</p>
<h2 nodeindex="50">How is a Seed Round different from a Series A?</h2>
<p nodeindex="51">Seed rounds and Series A are both part of the path for a startup’s success. However, even though these two types of fundraising are different, I see a large amount of founder confusion on whether they are ready for a seed round or a Series A.</p>
<p nodeindex="52">While the choice may seem straightforward, it can be tough for a founder to know where their business stands. If they have a solid foundation, a Series A might be more appropriate. If they don’t, a seed may work better. However, it’s tough for founders to suss out what a good foundation even looks like.</p>
<p nodeindex="53">Part of the problem is a conflation of the two. Here are the basic definitions for both:</p>
<ul nodeindex="55"><li nodeindex="54"><b nodeindex="312">Seed round –</b> A seed round typically can be anywhere from several hundred thousand dollars to several million, and is raised from seed funds and high net worth angel investors. Usually the startup is expected to use the investment for market research and early product development. Investors are rewarded with stock options, convertible notes, or equity.</li>
<li nodeindex="56"><b nodeindex="313">Series A –</b>A typical VC-led Series A is now five to ten million. Series A gets its name from the type of equity investors hope to receive one day– Series A Preferred Shares.</li>
</ul><p nodeindex="57">These standard definitions are helpful, but they don’t necessarily help founders determine what fundraising round is right for them.</p>
<h3 nodeindex="58">Are you ready for a Seed Round or Series A?</h3>
<p nodeindex="59">A Series A often happens after a seed round, but some companies have managed to bootstrap their way to success. These businesses may be able to skip the seed round.</p>
<p nodeindex="60">You are probably ready for a Series A if:</p>
<ul nodeindex="62"><li nodeindex="61">You have compelling metrics (growth, unit economics), have figured out customer acquisition, and are growing rapidly</li>
<li nodeindex="63">You are building into a large space that can support a company worth hundreds of millions or more</li>
<li nodeindex="64">You have a strong team</li>
</ul><p nodeindex="65">If these are not true, you are probably a seed stage company and should target raising a seed round.</p>
<p nodeindex="66">Sometimes there are exceptions to the rule: if you have a particularly compelling team or vision you may be able to raise a Series A without metrics. However, most companies are not the exception and you should be realistic.</p>
<p nodeindex="67">To raise a seed round, you don’t have to have everything figured out yet.</p>
<p nodeindex="68">Usually you should have assembled a founding team and have built something. Not having built something is a warning sign to investors, because the cost of creating software is now so low you can get started while you have a day job.</p>
<p nodeindex="69">Often, I get founders telling me they need to raise a seed round to get started building, sometimes because they themselves don’t have the technical ability to build something and they need to hire a team. From the investor perspective, this is a weak argument: why would I back you instead of another founding team with technical chops?</p>
<h3 nodeindex="70">How developed should a product be to raise a Seed Round?</h3>
<p nodeindex="71">With the cost of rolling out an MVP (minimum viable product) lowering every year, many startups think you need a prototype in order to raise a seed round.</p>
<p nodeindex="72">A prototype is helpful, but the level of traction needed to de-risk the full product potential is not usually possible with such prototypes. In the best case scenario, the MVP doesn’t de-risk the idea. In the worst case scenario, the MVP gets poor results due to lack of resources.</p>
<p nodeindex="73">When it comes to raising a seed round, focus the pitch and communication efforts on de-risking the team and space. The seed investor needs to walk away believing in a huge market potential and the team has what it takes to capture it.</p>
<h2 nodeindex="74">Key investment terms to know</h2>
<p nodeindex="75">Before we get started, there are a few terms you need to understand to read this guide:</p>
<h4 nodeindex="314">SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)</h4>
<p nodeindex="76">SAFE, which stands for Simple Agreement for Future Equity, is a simple contractual agreement a company makes with an investor guaranteeing them equity in a future priced financing round. This is now the standard for seed investing, because of its simplicity and low cost.</p>
<h4 nodeindex="315">Valuation cap (or “cap”)</h4>
<p nodeindex="77">The valuation cap is the pre-money conversion price of the investment. These valuation caps apply to convertible notes, which is a hybrid of debt and equity, as well as SAFEs (referenced above). These caps protect investors and allow companies to postpone setting valuations.</p>
<h4 nodeindex="316">Pre-money valuation</h4>
<p nodeindex="78">A pre-money valuation is the valuation of a company prior to investment or financing. Once a company receives investment and the capital hits the bank, it will have a post-money valuation.</p>
<h4 nodeindex="317">Post-money valuation</h4>
<p nodeindex="79">The post-money valuation is the company’s valuation after the investment (pre-money valuation + amount invested = post-money valuation).</p>
<h2 nodeindex="80">How investing environments have evolved</h2>
<p nodeindex="81">The investment environment has changed a lot for private technology companies in the past 15 years. Here’s a quick comparison of today vs. when I started over 10 years ago.</p>
<h4 nodeindex="318">The investment environment in 2007</h4>
<p nodeindex="82">When we raised our first seed round for Justin.tv in 2007, we raised 250k at a 3mm pre-money valuation (and this was considered very high!).</p>
<p nodeindex="83">Raising money from seed investors was a very linear, manual process: we would meet an investor (usually referred by a fellow entrepreneur), ask them if they would invest, and then go to the next investor.</p>
<p nodeindex="84">When we had enough investor commitments, we did a priced round and collected the entire $250k at the same time. Raising our seed round took months. I call this the&nbsp;<b nodeindex="319">hunter-gatherer method&nbsp;</b>of fundraising.</p>
<h4 nodeindex="320">The investment environment in 2018</h4>
<p nodeindex="85">Because of a nine year bull market in tech driven by low interest rates and a mobile boom, money has poured into the tech ecosystem —&nbsp;all in search of high growth startups.</p>
<p nodeindex="86">Even more importantly has been the inventions of Y Combinator’s Demo Day and the SAFE.</p>
<p nodeindex="87">On Demo Day, YC startups will pitch in front of an audience of 500 Silicon Valley investors (with even more watching online). These investors will invest in YC companies using the Simple Agreement for Future Equity, a lightweight convertible security that allows investors to sign a simple contract and immediately wire money.</p>
<p nodeindex="88">Most importantly, it is an open standard that has been accepted by the market, and it allows founders to collect money in smaller increments (instead of raising their whole round at once).</p>
<p nodeindex="89">By bringing all investors together on one day and making it fast to invest in them, YC has done the closest thing ever to creating a liquid market for startup equity. This is the equivalent to the fundraising invention of&nbsp;<b nodeindex="321">agriculture.</b></p>
<h4 nodeindex="322">Understanding high resolution fundraising</h4>
<p nodeindex="90">Because of this, startup investing has changed to be&nbsp;<b nodeindex="323">high resolution fundraising</b>: early investors will often be rewarded with lower valuation caps than later investors.</p>
<p nodeindex="91">For example, a company might raise and collect its first 500k pre-Demo Day at a 6 million cap, and then raise another $1mm at an 8 million cap after Demo Day, when they have momentum in their round (it is lower risk for an investor to invest once the company has already raised some of its money, because it is much more likely they will get to the whole amount they need).</p>
<p nodeindex="92">This can be better for founders, because it often minimizes total dilution they take in the seed round.</p>
<p nodeindex="93">However, many founders improperly estimate the total dilution they will experience and raise too much, often making them very sad at their ownership when all of these SAFEs convert in a Series A.</p>
<h4 nodeindex="324">Your narrative is your fundraising</h4>
<p nodeindex="94">The most important thing in any fundraising (whether seed or later stage) is your narrative, and every narrative follows the same arc.</p>
<p nodeindex="95">In the case of a pitch to investors, the narrative for a seed stage company will break down into these three acts:</p>
<ol nodeindex="97"><li nodeindex="96"><b nodeindex="325">The world is a certain way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>What is the problem you are solving? How did you get exposure to it / why are you an expert? Why is it a big and important problem to solve?</li>
<li nodeindex="98"><b nodeindex="326">Something changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>What is your solution? Why is now the time to do it?</li>
<li nodeindex="99"><b nodeindex="327">The world is a new way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>How does the company (and therefore the investors) benefit from bringing this solution to market?</li>
</ol><p nodeindex="100">I like to write out my narrative (in an outline format) and practice with friends and fellow entrepreneurs. It is important to get feedback and see what objections and points of confusion smart people bring up; those are the same places that investors are going to get stuck.</p>
<p nodeindex="101"><strong nodeindex="328">Once you have your narrative, you can make a short slide deck.</strong></p>
<p nodeindex="102">I recommend limiting your seed stage pitch deck to six compelling slides that follow your narrative:</p>
<ul nodeindex="104"><li nodeindex="103">Problem</li>
<li nodeindex="105">Scope of problem</li>
<li nodeindex="106">Why now</li>
<li nodeindex="107">Solution</li>
<li nodeindex="108">Traction (if any)</li>
<li nodeindex="109">Team</li>
</ul><p nodeindex="110">If you break up some of the stages into multiple slides (like the following example), that’s fine —&nbsp;just make sure the additional slides truly add value.</p>
<p nodeindex="111">One great example of a seed stage deck is Alto Pharmacy (previously ScriptDash).</p>
<p nodeindex="112">They tell a compelling narrative and cover 5/6 factors above – no traction, as they hadn’t generated any yet (they’ve since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/12/pill-delivery-startup-scriptdash-rebrands-as-alto-inks-23-million-for-nationwide-expansion/" nodeindex="329">raised a Series B</a>). To see a proven pitch in action, download the Alto seed round pitch deck below:</p>

<h2 nodeindex="129">How to pick a valuation for your seed round</h2>
<p nodeindex="130">One of the hardest things with seed stage fundraising today is picking a valuation.</p>
<p nodeindex="131">This is hard because you generally need to tell investors you are fundraising at a certain valuation before you really know what demand at that price point is.</p>
<p nodeindex="132">Further complicating things is that too low of a valuation can be a negative signal in today’s hot market, especially if you are participating in a program like Y Combinator.</p>
<h4 nodeindex="330">What is an average seed round valuation?</h4>
<p nodeindex="133">Generally seed stage valuations are anywhere from a $2MM to $10-20MM (for more experienced entrepreneurs). This is a huge range, reflecting the huge range in demand for different kinds of companies.</p>
<p nodeindex="134">The truth is that market size should also affect the valuation that investors are willing to invest at. Often companies come out of YC with unrealistically high valuation expectations, which don’t make sense because the industry they are building into isn’t big enough to support a 30x+ outcome.</p>
<p nodeindex="135">This can sour investors and make it difficult to raise a round.</p>
<h4 nodeindex="331">Process for calculating your seed valuation</h4>
<p nodeindex="136">When it comes to raising a seed round, it’s hard to know how to value your startup. That’s because you’re raising money before you’ve found product market fit, determined your growth goals, and built a team.</p>
<p nodeindex="137">Even so, it is possible to calculate a seed valuation.</p>
<h5 nodeindex="332">Setting Milestones</h5>
<p nodeindex="138">At minimum, you need to set milestones that you want to achieve in a certain amount of time. For example, you might want $50k monthly revenue within 2 years, a team of 10, expansion into two new verticals. From there, you must decide on the resources you need to reach these milestones and how much this will cost you on a monthly basis. This becomes your burn.</p>
<h5 nodeindex="333">Equity &amp; Pre-money Valuation</h5>
<p nodeindex="139">You’ll also need to:</p>
<ol nodeindex="141"><li nodeindex="140">Decide on how much equity you will give away at this early stage, knowing that you may need to give more away in additional funding rounds</li>
<li nodeindex="142">Calculate your pre-money valuation.</li>
</ol><p nodeindex="143"><b nodeindex="334">Pre-revenue valuation is more art than science&nbsp;</b>because all investments are based on potential, not results.</p>
<p nodeindex="144">They are forward-priced and are based on gut-level estimates from seasoned angel and seed stage investors. &nbsp;Valuation at this stage serves as a signal for where the company, based on team and space, can ultimately go. &nbsp;Sending the wrong signal can attract wrong investors, which can set the company up for the wrong growth trajectory.</p>
<p nodeindex="145">When it comes to calculating a valuation, accelerators and investors are great resources to turn to. But be warned:&nbsp;<b nodeindex="335">they may give you a biased answer since they may be seeking the best terms for their own investment in your company.</b></p>
<h4 nodeindex="336">Mentors and Programs</h4>
<p nodeindex="146">Like any other part of the company building process, it’s helpful to seek advice from those who have done it before.</p>
<p nodeindex="147">Having a founder or investor to mentor you throughout the early stages of your company can be the difference between survival and demise.</p>
<p nodeindex="148">Outside of informal relationships, there are structured programs or bootcamps to help you prepare for the valuation process. Here at Atrium we have <a href="https://scale.atrium.co/" nodeindex="337">Atrium Scale</a>, an application-only mentorship program that gives founders:</p>
<ol nodeindex="150"><li nodeindex="149">Help with their fundraising efforts</li>
<li nodeindex="151">A better a sense of valuation and how to approach it for their startup</li>
<li nodeindex="152">A platform to workshop their pitch – and then get intros to investors</li>
</ol><p nodeindex="153">Given our team’s experience raising over $100M, we offer this resource to well-qualified early-stage companies that can use the experience to their advantage.</p>
<h3 nodeindex="154">Other factors affecting seed round</h3>
<p nodeindex="155">When raising a seed round, there are a few other factors to consider. These include:</p>
<ul nodeindex="157"><li nodeindex="156"><b nodeindex="338">Timing:</b> Don’t try to raise a seed round when people tend to be OOO – think August, December, July.</li>
<li nodeindex="158"><b nodeindex="339">Dilution:</b> Fundraising isn’t easy, but that doesn’t mean you have to take every penny that you can get. Be wary of dilution and set a maximum amount to raise.</li>
<li nodeindex="159"><b nodeindex="340">Approach:</b> Do you want to raise at different caps and valuations over time, or in one batch? Paul Graham advocates for <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/fr.html" nodeindex="341">minimizing the amount of time in ‘fundraise mode’</a><span nodeindex="342">, so you can focus on business.</span></li>
<li nodeindex="160"><b nodeindex="343">Fundraising environment:&nbsp;</b>Understand the state of the market with an index such as the free one <a href="http://www.goodwatercap.com/index" nodeindex="344">provided by GoodWater</a>.</li>
<li nodeindex="161"><b nodeindex="345">Valuation caps:&nbsp;</b>In seed rounds, it’s common to raise money through convertible notes and SAFEs. But when investors use convertible notes, they use valuation caps. The valuation cap is the pre-money conversion price of the investment.These valuation caps apply to convertible notes, which is a hybrid of debt and equity. These caps protect investors and allow companies to postpone setting valuations.</li>
<li nodeindex="162"><b nodeindex="346">Discounts: &nbsp;</b><span nodeindex="347">Discounts give investors the opportunity and right to purchase shares at a discount in subsequent funding rounds.</span></li>
</ul><h2 nodeindex="163">Types of seed investors</h2>
<p nodeindex="164">There are several different types of seed stage investors. It’s good to know which kind you are talking to —&nbsp;which will help you understand their goals and objectives.</p>
<p nodeindex="165">Each one of these can be broken down further, but here is a high-level summary:</p>
<h3 nodeindex="166">1. Angel investors (high net worth individuals)</h3>
<p nodeindex="167">These are typically rich people who have made money in tech (either by investing or by starting a company or being an executive).</p>
<p nodeindex="168">They can make decisions very quickly, because they are investing their own money, often on a whim. Investment decisions are usually made on their gut feel, whether they have experienced the problem or have knowledge of the market, and how compelling they find you as a founder.</p>
<p nodeindex="169"><b nodeindex="348">Typical check size:&nbsp;</b>$10K – $300K</p>
<h3 nodeindex="170">2. Seed funds</h3>
<p nodeindex="171">These are funds that focus on investing in seed rounds of startups. They can either participate, or lead a round.</p>
<p nodeindex="172">Often the funds have multiple partners, and you may have to meet more than one to get a check.</p>
<p nodeindex="173"><b nodeindex="349">Typical check size:&nbsp;</b>$100K – $500K</p>
<h3 nodeindex="174">3. Venture Capital Funds (VCs)</h3>
<p nodeindex="175"><b nodeindex="350">Generally speaking, VCs only invest in seed deals as lead gen for Series As</b>.</p>
<p nodeindex="176">They want to stay close to you so that in the event you actually build a good company they can build a relationship and lead your next round.</p>
<p nodeindex="177"><b nodeindex="351">Typical check size:&nbsp;</b><span nodeindex="352">$200K – $1MM</span></p>
<h3 nodeindex="178">What they have in common</h3>
<p nodeindex="179">There are some commonalities across all investors.</p>
<ol nodeindex="181"><li nodeindex="180">Investors want to invest in things that have fundraising momentum already, which is why the first check is the hardest to get.</li>
<li nodeindex="182">None of these investors are investing for 10% IRR. Many companies present an idea that can be a fine business, and will become profitable, but isn’t making a huge splash in a big industry.</li>
</ol><p nodeindex="183">Seed stage tech investors don’t want to invest in those companies (they call them “lifestyle businesses”). This is because seed stage investors are looking for double digit multiple returns from single investments, which in turn pay for all the failed companies they invested in.</p>
<p nodeindex="184"><b nodeindex="353">When you think of fundraising,</b> <a href="https://www.atrium.co/blog/how-to-meet-investors/" nodeindex="354"><b nodeindex="355">think of it like a sales funnel.</b></a></p>
<p nodeindex="185">Not every lead is going to get to the bottom and close, and you shouldn’t take offense when someone says no.</p>
<p nodeindex="186">In order to close a certain number of sales (aka raise your round) you will need to fill the top of the funnel with many leads, and expect attrition. A healthy attitude here is to go in expecting some rejection (or even more likely, some investors to just ghost on you and stop responding to emails).</p>
<h2 nodeindex="187">How to get introductions to investors</h2>
<p nodeindex="188">I wrote an entire guide on <a href="https://www.atrium.co/blog/how-to-find-meet-investors/" nodeindex="356">how to get investor intros</a>, which goes into greater detail and provides an example of emails that get intros. I recommend that you check it out once you have your seed-stage strategy in place.</p>
<p nodeindex="189">There are two types of people you should target to provide intros to investors:</p>
<ul nodeindex="191"><li nodeindex="190">Founders who have been funded by that investor</li>
<li nodeindex="192">Investors who have invested in your company already.</li>
</ul><p nodeindex="193">This is because of social proof:&nbsp;<b nodeindex="357">you want to get an intro from someone the investor respects and/or has put her money where her mouth is.</b></p>
<p nodeindex="194">Sometimes an investor who hasn’t invested will offer to intro you to another investor.</p>
<p nodeindex="195">Don’t take it!</p>
<p nodeindex="196">The signal you are sending is bad; if you were a good investment, the first investor would have invested.</p>
<p nodeindex="197">It pays to optimize your process: when you sit down with friends / investors and ask for intros, come prepared with a list of people you want to talk to and ask “who on this list do you know?” It is very difficult for your allies to respond to the open ended question “what investors will be interested in my company?”</p>
<p nodeindex="198">Odds are, your friends won’t have a mapping of investors to types of companies they are interested in in their heads.</p>
<p nodeindex="199">Cold emailing investors almost never works.</p>
<p nodeindex="200">Most people who are out there as investors have been cold emailed before, and may have even met up once or twice with one of those founders. However, they almost never lead to an investment. Make the time and effort to find a warm intro.</p>
<h3 nodeindex="201">Meeting investors in the first place</h3>
<p nodeindex="202">After you get introduced to an investor, you should arrange a meeting with them. An in-person is generally better than a phone call; investors invest in founders, and you will have more opportunities to display excitement for your company in an in person meeting.</p>
<p nodeindex="203">A successful investor meeting will be more conversation than pitch.</p>
<p nodeindex="204">You may choose to walk through your deck, although generally I suggest you just have a conversation around your narrative without your deck (unless specifically asked).</p>
<p nodeindex="205">You can tell if an investor is engaged if they are asking questions about your business.</p>
<p nodeindex="206">If they are really engaged they will start getting excited and coming up ideas themselves for where you can take your startup. This is when you really know you’ve got a good chance to close them.</p>
<p nodeindex="207">When you go into the meeting, you not only want to be prepared to share your company’s story and vision;&nbsp;<b nodeindex="358">you want to make a good impression on the investor.</b></p>
<p nodeindex="208">After all, they’re not just investing in your company, but&nbsp;<b nodeindex="359">they’re investing in you</b>.</p>
<p nodeindex="209">Here are a few points of advice for going into meetings with investors:</p>
<ul nodeindex="211"><li nodeindex="210"><b nodeindex="360">Don’t make assumptions about what the investor does and doesn’t know.</b> The investors may have the reputation for knowing about certain technologies, but be sure to spell out your goals and visions as clearly as possible.</li>
<li nodeindex="212"><b nodeindex="361">The first meeting may be a starting point OR your chance to close the deal.</b>You need to read the situation and figure out if you’re playing a medium or short-term game.Some investors fall in love on the first date; others need to be courted and convinced.</li>
<li nodeindex="213"><b nodeindex="362">Be honest about where you’re at.</b>Many deals fall apart because it becomes clear that a founder was lying about the facts. Don’t lie about commitments, relationships, milestones, or anything else. The truth will come out.</li>
<li nodeindex="214"><b nodeindex="363">Nail down your unique selling point (USP).</b> Your USP is why investors will be interested in supporting your company. Make sure you’re able to show this clearly in meetings.</li>
</ul><h2 nodeindex="215">How to close a seed investment</h2>
<p nodeindex="216">Usually you can close seed investments quickly. Skilled (and/or lucky) fundraisers can close a round in 4 – 8 weeks.</p>
<p nodeindex="217">Successfully raising an investment round involves many basic sales tactics to engage your prospective “clients”.</p>
<h3 nodeindex="218">1. Be Direct</h3>
<p nodeindex="219"><b nodeindex="364">Your goal in a meeting is to move the conversation along and get a firm commitment for an investment</b>. Often times founders struggle to directly ask “we’d love to have you as an investor: will you invest?” and instead wait for the investor to ask for the terms of the deal and suggest they are interested.</p>
<p nodeindex="220">However, in these meetings, it’s best to&nbsp;<b nodeindex="365">be as direct as possible.</b></p>
<ul nodeindex="222"><li nodeindex="221">Ask the pointed questions that you want answered.</li>
<li nodeindex="223">Once you have a firm commitment, make sure the deal is one that works for you. Consider whether the investment terms are fair, and have your lawyer walk through the options with you.</li>
<li nodeindex="224">Don’t dally on sending paperwork, either. Have your lawyer send a SAFE, or use&nbsp;<a href="https://www.clerky.com/" nodeindex="366">Clerky</a>.</li>
</ul><h3 nodeindex="225">2. Clarify your time frames</h3>
<p nodeindex="226">Don’t put an arbitrary “soon” date on your round —&nbsp;clarify the time so you can bring about a legitimate sense of urgency. “Soon” can be a default to “no.”</p>
<p nodeindex="227">Make it clear what date you want money in the bank, which will also filter out investors who aren’t prepared to move quickly enough.</p>
<h3 nodeindex="228">3. Observe the “Handshake Protocol”</h3>
<p nodeindex="229">Startups move faster than complex legal processes, hence the need for a way to enforce commitments before they can reach their legal conclusion.</p>
<p nodeindex="230"><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/handshake/" nodeindex="367">The YC Handshake Protocol</a> is recognized as a code of ethics (by most) in Silicon Valley. Commitments go both ways: don’t back out from investors —&nbsp;or feel guilty if investors back out from your seed round —&nbsp;after the following 4 steps have been completed:</p>
<ol nodeindex="232"><li nodeindex="231"><em nodeindex="368">The investor says “I’m in for [offer].”</em></li>
<li nodeindex="233"><em nodeindex="369">The startup says “Ok, you’re in for [offer].”</em></li>
<li nodeindex="234"><em nodeindex="370">The startup sends the investor an email or text message saying “This is to confirm you’re in for [offer]. This offer is valid for 48 hours, please confirm acceptance. You agree to fund your investment no later than 10 business days from the date of your acceptance of this offer.”</em></li>
<li nodeindex="235"><em nodeindex="371">The investor replies yes.</em></li>
</ol><h2 nodeindex="236">Conclusion: discipline is key for seed round fundraising</h2>
<p nodeindex="237">As you raise your seed round, stay disciplined and work systematically to make the best decisions for your company.</p>
<p nodeindex="238">This requires making sure you’re knowledgeable about seed rounds and their terms, cultivating relationships with the right people, and preparing to meet with investors. Most importantly, you need to have a lawyer review your terms to ensure they are fair and not something that would come back to haunt you.</p>
